# docker-node-react-base

A basic setup for docker that has a node backend and a react front end that makes a simple api call for a cat fact

The docker sets up the front end to use port 3000 since my local docker setup is using port 8080. 3000 should normally be changed to 8080.

The start command was only there to add a clickable icon on the desktop to start up the containers but probably not necessary.

Can use docker-compose up to start this up.
